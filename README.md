SoulGuard:
This mod is a death chest replacment mod. Instead of placing a chest or grave where you died to store your items and exp for recovery, they will be placed into your soul. A floating ball of particles that you can touch to reclaim. Fully configurable to be pretty much whatever and however you like. You can even use custom sounds for your souls with support for resource packs.
